# Stage 3 - Atomic & SOLID
 
When creating UI it's important to know what constitutes a component and what does not. Where does a components single responsibility begin and end? How do we create components that make logical sense and follow a pattern we can move forward with intuitively? Atomic design patterns and SOLID engineering principles help with this significantly.
