# Stage 5 - Testing

Testing is super important inside a UI project as they can become very complex. To do this we will look at several things:
- AAA testing
- Heavy abstraction in the render of a react component
- Understanding pure functions and why they are important and how to test them

## Outcomes
- Understand AAA
- Understand how to use snapshots\
- Understand how to write production code that's easily testable

## Measure
- Add tests to your react app
- Abstract logic into pure functions and test them
- Generate snapshots for components and views
