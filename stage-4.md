# Stage 4 - Storybooks

The Storybooks system allows us to showcase UI components in isolation in a library. This provides many different benefits but the main ones are:
- Engineers can quickly and easily access documentation on components and see what's already available to them
- Stakeholders can see demos of components in isolation
- Components are built in isolation from the rest of the app ensuring a decoupled and independent final result.

## Outcomes
- Understand storybooks as a technology
- Understand how to set up a basic storybooks implementation
- Understand how to develop components inside storybooks
- Understand how to document components engineered inside storybooks.

## Measure
Add storybooks to the react app and move the atomic components inside.
